## Overview

Packet Extension Theory extends quantum mechanics by introducing **information density** as a dynamical physical field. Unlike interpretational approaches, PET makes concrete, testable predictions that distinguish it from standard quantum mechanics.

### Core Innovation
```
Standard QM: i‚Ñè ‚àÇœà/‚àÇt = Hœà
PET:         i‚Ñè ‚àÇœà/‚àÇt = Hœà + V_info[œÅ_info]œà
```

Where `œÅ_info(x,t)` is the information density field and `V_info` represents the coupling between information density and quantum dynamics.

### Key Predictions

- **Modified uncertainty relations**: `ŒîxŒîp ‚â• ‚Ñè/2 √ó [1 + Œ≤‚à´œÅ_info¬≤dx]`
- **Measurement debris**: Detectable energy signatures from information redistribution
- **Shannon universality**: Physical basis for information theory's success across domains
- **Hard localization bounds**: Fundamental limits beyond Heisenberg uncertainty
- **QFT extensions**: Information density effects in particle physics and cosmology

## Scientific Impact

PET addresses fundamental questions across multiple domains:
- **Quantum Foundations**: Resolves wave-particle duality through packet ontology
- **Information Theory**: Explains Shannon's universal applicability via physical information fields
- **Particle Physics**: Predicts modifications to Standard Model processes
- **Cosmology**: Information density contributions to early universe dynamics
- **Quantum Technology**: Fundamental limits on quantum information protocols
