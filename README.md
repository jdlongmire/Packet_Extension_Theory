## Updated Results Paper, 07-21-2025 | AI-Accelerated Development from Theory to Hardware Implementation: Experimental Framework for Testing Information-Dependent Quantum Decoherence

This paper introduces **Packet Extension Theory (PET)**‚Äîan information-theoretic extension to quantum mechanics that predicts quantum decoherence rates depend on the information content of quantum states, not just environmental interactions. The entire research cycle, from theoretical conception to experimental quantum hardware tests, was developed in just 16 hours using an AI-accelerated workflow (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) and Lean 4 for formalization.

Key features:
- **Rapid, end-to-end AI-assisted pipeline:** Theory development, Lean 4 formal verification, code generation, and IBM Quantum experiments.
- **Formalized and testable predictions:** PET proposes that coherence times (T2*) systematically vary with quantum state complexity (via Fisher information).
- **Reproducible open science:** Full mathematical proofs, code, experimental protocols, and results are available.
- **Clear limitations and next steps:** Includes analysis of hardware precision gaps and methodological transparency.

## Overview

Packet Extension Theory extends quantum mechanics by introducing **information density** as a dynamical physical field. Unlike interpretational approaches, PET makes concrete, testable predictions that distinguish it from standard quantum mechanics.

### Core Innovation
```
Standard QM: i‚Ñè ‚àÇœà/‚àÇt = Hœà
PET:         i‚Ñè ‚àÇœà/‚àÇt = Hœà + V_info[œÅ_info]œà
```

Where `œÅ_info(x,t)` is the information density field and `V_info` represents the coupling between information density and quantum dynamics.

### Key Predictions

- **Modified uncertainty relations**: `ŒîxŒîp ‚â• ‚Ñè/2 √ó [1 + Œ≤‚à´œÅ_info¬≤dx]`
- **Measurement debris**: Detectable energy signatures from information redistribution
- **Shannon universality**: Physical basis for information theory's success across domains
- **Hard localization bounds**: Fundamental limits beyond Heisenberg uncertainty
- **QFT extensions**: Information density effects in particle physics and cosmology

## Scientific Impact

PET addresses fundamental questions across multiple domains:
- **Quantum Foundations**: Resolves wave-particle duality through packet ontology
- **Information Theory**: Explains Shannon's universal applicability via physical information fields
- **Particle Physics**: Predicts modifications to Standard Model processes
- **Cosmology**: Information density contributions to early universe dynamics
- **Quantum Technology**: Fundamental limits on quantum information protocols
